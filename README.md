# Python
A repository (repo) to learn more about Git and GitHub. Also to use it integrated with programming.
## Language
I start with Python since it will be the most ueful language for programming Raspberry Pi and integrate with Arduino. I think it will be useful in the Statistical Toolbox couorse as well. Besides Git and GitHub, the most important thing will be to get a grip of R and RStudio
## Files in this repo so far
To begin with I have chosen:
* ex8_4.py - a small file for counting words in romeo.txt
* romeo.txt - sample file for aove
* ex10_1.py - a small file for counting emails in a larger sample file.
* mbox-short.txt - sample file for above file
Added:
* ex7_2.py - small file for counting
* ex10_2.py - ?

### Course for the files
All files are the result of the Coursera course "Programming for Everybody" - with Dr. Chuck
It's a really nice course as a first step to learn Python.

I will update with more files as I go along. Also explore branches.
Todays first challenge is to update this file to my local repo.
Success - Managed to add two more files from local repo and to update README.md to local repo. Now I'll update this text from local to remote.
